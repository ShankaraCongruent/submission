1. developed using c#(.NET 8)
2. DB name: training
	Schema name: training
	Entity format: traning.training.[EnitityName]
	NOTE: should not use master, all db, schema everything should be lowecase
3. All entity has 4 Audit columns: CreatedBy, CreatedOn, ModifiedBy, ModifiedOn
4. Dependency Injection is used for services and repositories.
5. Exception handling with try/catch at the service and controller level.
6. Each User can multiple Accounts, but each account belong to one branch.
7. Each Bank can have multiple branches and one manager.
8. Accounts can be of 3 types:
	- savings
	- current
	- TermDeposit
9. currency allows multi-currency accounts(for NRI users)
10. Roles to determine user privileges:
			ROLE 				ACTIONS
			NormalUser			Balance, deposit,withdraw(limited because if user age<18 need POA), operate accounts(change PIN)
			BankUser			Operate accounts of customer(update user mobileNo)
			Admin				manage banks, branches and users
Implicit assumptions:
	1.Using NVARCHAR datatype in most places to eliminate unicode error '[?]' and support data entered by user is being consistent in the database. 
	2. Assuming IDENTITY(seed,increment) for all PK to ensure auto increment for all records that is being inserted.
	3. Assuming DEFAULT for ModifiedOn field to record the time automatically.
	4. Assuming AccountType CHECK (AccountType IN('Saving','Current','TermDeposit')). This can also be acheived by writing them in Enum
