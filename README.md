# Core README

## Changelog

- Nov 16 2025 - Sriram added a folder called SRIRAM_CODE that contains sample code for verify and refresh login

### Notes

- Read the code first and then include into your own controllers.
- Be careful of what is being used for sub vs FullName. You will need fullName to be set
- You will also need a /logout API. **Why?**
- The files have been provided as .TXT files. Copy the relevant sections into your controllers and services with due modification.


This project was completed with CRUD operation and few actions like deposit, withdraw, manage users with role based authorization upon roleId. There are few pieces of permission based logics are inside the project for future extension.
Basic explicit expectations for this project were implemented as follows

1. Try, catch
2. ILogger
3. SOLID principle(not all principle but few of them :) )
4. oop concepts
5. 4 audit fields
6. Minor cannot withdraw money
7. Three types of user(Admin, BankUser, NormalUser)
